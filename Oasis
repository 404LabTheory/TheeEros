# Eros Index — Free Chatbot (No API)

A free static website that behaves like an embedded AI chatbot:
- Asks the Eros Index questions (Likert + text)
- Uses smart follow-ups (branching)
- Scores subfactors and returns an archetype + confidence
- Stores progress in LocalStorage
- Exports responses as JSON

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Go to **Settings → Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **main**
4. Folder: **/(root)**
5. Save

Your site will be available at:
`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/eros-index-chatbot/`

## Notes
- No backend, no database, no API costs.
- Prototype scoring is heuristic and can later be replaced with LPA centroids from dissertation data.
